# PRODIGY_CS_01: Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

## Overview
This repository contains a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform the encryption and decryption processes.

## Features
- Encrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Allows users to input a custom shift value.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fl0ki0/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd PRODIGY_CS_01
    ```
3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```

## Example
```plaintext
Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt? e
Enter your message: Hello, World!
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypted message: Khoor, Zruog!
```
